# Warehouse-Analytics
Data is an important aspect of any business for faster decision making. The way we can organize the data in the warehouse to the day to day updates improves these decisions. This is called supply chain management. The famous business enterprises like Walmart, Amazonâ€¦etc. use the warehouses to meet the demand of the delivery of the goods on a timely manner for a bigger population especially in cities. There are many startups recently that introduced the concept of delivery in minutes. The main strategy that runs these ideas is the warehouse. We are going to show how the databases can be used to perform the warehouse management and retrieve the information for various business insights. The maintaining of the warehouses in the Relational databases gives an easy way to take the insights on where the demand is! This gives the companies to sell their products easily without squandering the stock. The basic idea is to develop a web application with the user interface to perform the CRUD operations and display the insights of items spread across different warehouses.
